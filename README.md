## 🧑‍💻 Developer Notes

* Built with modular, readable JavaScript: easy to extend or integrate into other projects.
* Strength estimation uses character variety + length heuristics and displays a human-readable crack time.
* Local UI state (e.g., theme preferences or last-used settings) can be stored in `localStorage` if desired.
* Accessibility: sensible focus states and visible labels, can be enhanced with ARIA attributes.

---

## ✅ Coming Soon / Ideas

* Export generated passwords as a secure CSV (with warnings).
* Toggleable hashing preview (SHA-256) for integration demos.
* Clipboard clear / auto-clear after N seconds for privacy.
* Accessibility audit & keyboard-only navigation improvements.
